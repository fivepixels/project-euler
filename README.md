# PROJECT EULER

This is the PROJECT EULER for TypeScript. I solve two problems every single day until I finish all 480 problems, expecting to take about 240 days, expecting to take about 240 days. As I progress on this project, I will add more languages, like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), or [Go](https://go.dev/).

## Table of Content

### Project Euler Problems 1 to 100

In this first set of challenges, you will use mathematical concepts like the Fibonacci sequence, prime number theory, and combinatorics to write efficient algorithms to solve these problems.

| Problems                       | Code                                 |

| [002](/problems/002/README.md) | [TypeScript](/problems/002/index.ts) |

### Project Euler Problems 101 to 200

In this set of challenges, you'll build upon the skills you learned in the first part of the course and use more advanced concepts like vector computation, Pascal's pyramid, and the RSA algorithm to solve these problems efficiently.

### Project Euler Problems 201 to 300

In this set of challenges, you'll continue to build upon the skills you learned earlier and use concepts like the binomial theorem, Hamming numbers, and the Collatz sequence to further develop your math and problem solving skills.

### Project Euler Problems 301 to 400

Here you will continue to flex your mathematical and algorithmic skills as you use concepts such as combinatorial game theory, bitwise operations, and Golomb's self-describing sequence to develop efficient solutions to these problems.

### Project Euler Problems 401 to 480

In this final set of challenges, you will need draw upon everything you learned up to this point and use advanced concepts like unitary divisors, the Kaprekar routine, and much more to solve these complex problems.
